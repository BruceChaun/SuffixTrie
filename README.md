### SuffixTrie

Implement suffix trie of c++ version, and refer to [CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckingsf/bioinfo-lectures/suffixtrees.pdf).

Files _SuffixNode_ and _SuffixTrie_ define the node and trie, respectively, and provide some basic public interfaces. In _SuffixTrie_, basic applications, like check whether a query string is a subtring of trie, are given.
